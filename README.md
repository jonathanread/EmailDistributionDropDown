# EmailDistributionDropDown
This is a Sitefinity form widget that allows the CMS user to configure a dropdown to send the form submitted email to that address. You must configure Notification & system SMTP within sitefinty. This is using Siteinity 9.1.6110, it's a nuget packge and can be revertto whatever version you need.

The Assembly will register the toolbox item and virtual path.  I will be honest I have not fully tested this, i pulled it from another project and changed namespacing.
